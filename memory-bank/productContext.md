# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Academic papers, particularly on ArXiv, can be dense and difficult to digest quickly. Researchers and enthusiasts often need a way to rapidly understand the core concepts of a paper without reading it line-by-line initially. HuggingXiv Chat bridges this gap by combining a discovery mechanism (Daily Papers) with an conversational interface, allowing users to "talk" to the paper.

## User Problems Solved
1.  **Information Overload**: The sheer volume of new papers is overwhelming. This app curates trending ones.
2.  **Comprehension Barrier**: Complex papers are hard to understand. The AI chat helper breaks down concepts, answers questions, and summarizes findings.
3.  **Static Interaction**: Traditional PDF reading is passive. The chat interface makes learning active and exploratory.

## User Experience Goals
-   **Visual Impact**: The application should feel distinct and modern, using the Neo-Brutalist style to stand out from standard "clean" SaaS aesthetics.
-   **Responsiveness**: Interactions, especially AI responses, must be fast and streaming to maintain flow.
-   **Simplicity**: The workflow from "finding a paper" to "chatting about it" should be seamless and intuitive.

## How it works
1.  **Browse**: Users land on a feed of daily papers from Hugging Face.
2.  **Select**: Clicking a paper opens a detailed view with the abstract.
3.  **Engage**: Users can immediately start chatting. The AI has the paper's abstract injected into its context, enabling it to answer specific questions.
