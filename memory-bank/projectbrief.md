# Project Brief: HuggingXiv Chat

## Overview
HuggingXiv Chat is a modern, brutalist-designed web application that serves as an interactive chat interface for discussing ArXiv papers. It leverages AI (OpenRouter/Gemini 2.5 Flash) to provide context-aware discussions about academic papers and integrates with Hugging Face Daily Papers for discovery.

## Core Features
- **Paper Discovery**: Browse trending papers sourced from Hugging Face Daily Papers.
- **Interactive Chat**: Discuss specific papers with an AI assistant that understands the paper's abstract and context.
- **Brutalist Design**: A distinctive "Neo-Brutalist" aesthetic with high contrast, bold borders, and vibrant colors.
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time, streaming AI responses for a fluid conversational experience.

## Goals
- Provide an accessible and engaging way for users to explore and understand academic papers.
- Demonstrate a unique UI design language (Neo-Brutalism) in a functional app.
- Seamlessly integrate multiple APIs (Hugging Face, OpenRouter/Gemini) to deliver value.

## Scope
- **Frontend**: React application built with Vite.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom configuration for the brutalist theme.
- **AI Integration**: Connection to OpenRouter API for LLM capabilities.
- **Data Source**: Hugging Face API for fetching daily paper content.
